/**
 * Doubly-linked list implementation of the {@code List} and {@code Deque}
 * interfaces.  Implements all optional list operations, and permits all
 * elements (including {@code null}).
 *
 * <p>All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked
 * list.  Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from
 * the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least
 * one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it <i>must</i> be
 * synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 * that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of
 * an element is not a structural modification.)  This is typically
 * accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
 * encapsulates the list.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedList Collections.synchronizedList}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the list:<pre>
 *   List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));</pre>
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by this class's {@code iterator} and
 * {@code listIterator} methods are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the list is
 * structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in
 * any way except through the Iterator's own {@code remove} or
 * {@code add} methods, the iterator will throw a {@link
 * ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than
 * risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
 * time in the future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness:   <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *
